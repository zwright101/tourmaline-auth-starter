# Prime Project Starter
This version uses React, Redux, Express, Passport, and PostgreSQL (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).

We **STRONGLY** recommend following these instructions carefully. It's a lot, and will take some time to set up, but your life will be much easier this way in the long run.

## Use the Template for This Repository (Don't Clone)

- Don't Fork or Clone. Instead, click the `Use this Template` button, and make a copy to your personal account.


## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Create database and table

Create a new database called `first-look` and create a `user` table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "password" VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL,
    "access_level" INT DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE "pets" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
    "user_id" INT REFERENCES "user"
);
```

If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `first-look` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js`

## Development Setup Instructions

- Run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
  ```
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
  ```
  While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm run server`
- Run `npm run client`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`
